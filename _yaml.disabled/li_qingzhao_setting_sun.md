fulltext: "落日鎔金， The setting sun is like melted gold; 暮雲合璧， the evening cloud circles the jade disc. 人在何處。 Where do I find myself? 染柳煙濃。 The willows are tinted with heavy mist; 吹梅笛怨， the flute plays the regretful tune “Plum Blossoms Fall.” 春意知幾許。 Who knows how much spring feeling is left? 元宵佳節， It is the First Full Moon Festival. 融和天氣， The weather is nice and balmy, 次第豈無風雨。 but how will there not be wind or rain in an instant? 來相召、 Someone invited me, 香車寶馬， sending a fragrant carriage and fine horses; 謝他酒朋詩侶。 yet I refused to be his companion for wine and songs. 中州盛日， In the glorious days in the MiddlelandThis is a typical reference to the territories of the Northern Song dynasty. In this case the Middleland specifically refers to the capital of the Northern Song dynasty, Bian Jing (now Kai Feng city in Henan Province, China).,\_ 閨門多暇， there was so much leisure in the women’s quarters. 記得偏重三五。 I remember how Three FiveThree Five refers to the fifteenth day of the first month in the lunar calendar, which is the First Full Moon Festival. was grandly celebrated.\_ 鋪翠冠兒， The kingfisher-feather caps, 撚金雪柳， the gold thread wrapping the snowy willows, 簇帶爭濟楚。 all kinds of hair ornaments, competing with one another in gorgeousness. 如今憔悴， Now I am haggard and sallow, 風鬟霜鬢， With wind-blown hair and frost-touched temples. 怕見夜間出去。 I refrain from going out at night. 不如向、 It is better to 簾兒底下， hide behind the lowered curtains, 聽人笑語。 listening to the talk and laughter of others. \n"
