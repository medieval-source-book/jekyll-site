  卜算子 To the tune “Fortune Teller” 黃州定慧院寓居作 Composed while lodging at Dinghui Monastery in HuangzhouSu Shi was banished to Huangzhou. Without a place to live, and shunned by the locals who feared being implicated if they associated with him, he had no choice but to lodge at the monastery. 缺月挂疏桐， The waning moon hangs on the thinning sycamore tree. 漏斷人初靜。 The dripping clock stopsThe dripping clock is a water clock; when all the water drips down, the clock stops, indicating that it is midnight.; all men become quiet. 時見幽人獨往來， Sometimes I would see an isolated man come and go on his own 縹緲孤鴻影。 like the distant and vague silhouette of a lone wild goose. 驚起卻回頭， Startled, it flies up and turns its head; 有恨無人省。 It has resentment in its heart yet no one notices. 揀盡寒枝不肯棲， Picking from all the cold branchesThere is a Chinese proverb that “good birds choose branches (that suit them) to rest on”, which means that good officials should choose their kings carefully to ensure that they (the officials) will be allowed to pursue their ambitions. Here, Su Shi depicts the goose’s refusal to pick from the branches to imply that he is unwilling to pursue his political ambitions any further., but not resting on any, 寂寞沙洲冷。 It is alone and abandoned on the freezing isle of sand.
