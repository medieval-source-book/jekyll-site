  西江月 To the tune “The Moon Over the West River”This song was written in 1079 when the speaker passed by the city of Yangzhou. 平山堂 Pingshan HallPingshan Hall was the study of Ouyang Xiu (1007-1072 CE), who was a mentor to Su Shi. This whole song is a commemoration of the speaker’s beloved teacher. 三過平山堂下， By the time I stopped by the Pingshan Hall for the third timeSu Shi was transferred to Hangzhou as a Tong Pan (a court official in charge of food transportation and irrigation works); later he was transferred to Mizhou in 1074. By the time he wrote the song, it was his third time being transferred and passing by Pingshan Hall on his journey to the new posting., 半生彈指聲中。 Half of my lifetime had gone in a flick of the finger“A flick of the finger” refers to the transitory nature of time. It is a quantifier for time in Buddhist Scriptures. According to Buddhist Scriptures, the time period of twenty thoughts equals a moment, and twenty moments equal a flick of the finger.. 十年不見老仙翁。 For ten years I have not seen the old immortalThe “old immortal” refers to the poet’s mentor and friend, Ouyang Xiu, who had already passed away when Su Shi wrote this song., 壁上龍蛇飛動。 On the walls, dragons fly and serpents moveThe “dragons” and “serpents” refer to Ouyang Xiu’s calligraphy.. 欲弔文章太守， I want to commemorate the Prefect of Fine Composition, 仍歌楊柳春風。 but instead, I sing the song for the willow and the spring breeze“The willow”, “the spring breeze”, and “the Prefect of Fine Composition” all come from Ouyang Xiu’s ci “Seeing Liu Zhongyuanfu Off For His Departure to Guard Weiyang”. “The Prefect of Fine Composition” was originally used by Ouyang Xiu to describe his friend, Liu Zhongyuanfu, but here, Su Shi is using it to refer to Ouyang Xiu. “The willow” and “the spring breeze” imagery are taken from the same song: “The willow planted by me [i.e. Ouyang Xiu] in front of Pingshan Hall, after I left, has turned green many times in the spring breeze”. Ouyang Xiu's song expresses a desire to live in the moment, which may also be the sentiment Su Shi wishes to convey with this line.. 休言萬事轉頭空。 Do not say that all things become empty in a blink of an eye. 未轉頭時皆夢。 Even before your eyes blink, it is all just a dream.
