  南歌子 To the tune “Southland Song” 鳳髻金泥帶 Phoenix-like bun and gold-pleated ribbon, 龍紋玉掌梳。 Hand-shaped jade comb with dragon pattern. 走來窗下笑相扶。 Running over to the window in laughter and snuggling up to her husband, 愛道畫眉深淺， Fondly asking him whether her the shade of her painted eyebrows, 入時無。 is fashionable or not. 弄筆偎人久， Playing with the brush and leaning into him for a long time, 描花試手初。 She tries to trace the embroidery with her hand for the first time. 等閒妨了繡功夫。 Casually, she delays the time for embroidery work. 笑問雙鴛鴦字， Smiling, she asked: “the two characters of yuan and yang,“Yuanyang” means mandarin duck. The character “yuan” refers to the male one, and “yang” the female. As mandarin ducks are often in pairs, they are regarded as a symbol for couples and marriage.  怎生書。 How should I write them?”
