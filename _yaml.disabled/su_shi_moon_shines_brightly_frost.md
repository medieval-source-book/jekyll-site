  永遇樂 To the tune “Always Encountering Joy” 彭城夜宿燕子樓 Staying the night in the Swallow Tower in Pengcheng 夢盼盼因作此詞 and dreaming about Panpan, I composed this song.Pengcheng was the name of a place near present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. Guan Panpan was a courtesan and became the concubine of a Tang Dynasty general. She swore to remain chaste for her lover and kept that promise for ten years after her lover’s death, until she herself passed away. The Swallow Tower was where she lived alone after her lover's death. 明月如霜， The moon shines so brightly that it looks like frost covers the ground, 好風如水， the pleasant wind is cool like water, 清景無限。 the pure view is boundless. 曲港跳魚， In the winding pondThis probably refers to a U-shaped pond., fish jump;  圓荷瀉露， dew drops fall from the round lotus leaves.  寂寞無人見。  [they are] lonely, for no one sees. 紞如三鼓， Bum and brum, the drum of midnight, 鏗然一葉， loud and clear—a leaf fallsThe speaker uses hyperbole, comparing the sound of a leaf falling to the beat of a drum to emphasize the quietness of the night.. 黯黯夢雲驚斷。 In the darkness, my dream of cloud“Dream of cloud” alludes to a work by Song Yu 宋玉, who lived during the Warring States period (453–221 BCE). This work, the Song of Gao Tang (高唐赋), narrates a brief love affair between the Huai King of Chu 楚怀王 and a mountain fairy which takes place in the king’s dream; in this dream, the mountain fairy describes her residence after their lovemaking as “made from the cloud in the morning, but comprised of rain in the evening”. The imagery of cloud and rain is often used as a euphemism for sexual intercourse in Chinese poetry. Here, however, the context indicates that the "dream of cloud" simply refers to meeting a beautiful woman (Guan Panpan) in a dream. is abruptly cut short. 夜茫茫， The night is vast and obscure, 重尋無處， nowhere could I find the things [that I dreamt of] again. 覺來小園行遍。 Awoken, I walk around in the small garden. 天涯倦客， I am an exhausted traveler at the edge of the world, 山中歸路， longing to return to the mountains. 望斷故園心眼。 I stare in the direction of my hometown yet it is so far away that my eyes wear out.  燕子樓空， The Swallow TowerSee first note, above. is empty. 佳人何在， Where is the fair one? 空鎖樓中燕。 The swallow is locked in the empty tower. 古今如夢， The past and the present are like dreams; 何曾夢覺， when do we ever wake up from them? 但有舊歡新怨。 There is just old love and new regrets. 異時對， In some future time, 黃樓夜景， In the night scene of the Yellow Tower,Yellow Tower is another famous tower near present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. Su Shi renovated the Yellow Tower while he was posted in Pengcheng. 爲餘浩嘆。 I hope that someone will utter a long sigh for me.
