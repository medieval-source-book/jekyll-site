fulltext: "怨王孫 To the tune “Yearning for the PrinceAccording to Tang Guizhang’s edition, the title should be 'Double Tune to \"Yearning for the Prince”' (双调怨王孙). This indicates that the ci is composed of two parts, possibly with different melodies.“ 湖上風來波浩渺。 Wind comes from the lake and the waves are misty and grand. 秋已暮、 The autumn is late; 紅稀香少。 the reds are rare and the fragrance faint. 水光山色與人親， The radiance of the water and the colors of the mountain are friendly to the people. 說不儘、 One cannot talk enough 無窮好。 about their endless beauty. 蓮子已成荷葉老。 The lotus seeds are ripe and the leaves are old, 清露洗、 Clear dew washes over 蘋花汀草。 the duckweed and the water-grass.\_ 眠沙鷗鷺不回頭， Gulls and egrets sleep on the sand without turning their heads, 似也恨、 as if they resent me 人歸早。 for returning too early. \n"
