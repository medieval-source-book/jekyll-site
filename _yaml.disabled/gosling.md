He let no one know about that. Nû was ez vor der hôchzît Now at that time, it was before the feast day die in dem winter gelît, which takes place in winter diu wîhennaht ist genant. and which is called Christmas. der abte besant zuohant The abbot immediately summoned kelner unde koche. cooks and cellarers. er sprach: "uns nâhet ein woche He said: "There is a week approaching daz wir singen müezen und lesen. when we must sing and read. nû sült ir der herren flîzic wesen Now, you should be attentive to the gentlemen daz ir uns ein wirtschaft gebent. by preparing a banquet for us. sô die liute mit arbeit lebent, The more tedium in people's lives, so sol man ir pflegen dester baz." the better they should be taken care of." die herren lobten alle daz. The gentlemen all praised that. Der junge münich stuont dâ bî. The young monk stood there with them Er sprach: "sît daz iuwer wille sî, and said: "Since you wish us daz wir vollez ampt süllen hân, to hold full high mass, my dear master sô sült ir nimmer verlân, you should not fail müge ez an iuwern staten sîn, if it is in your power so schaffet, lieber herre mîn, to provide daz iedem man ein gans werde: every man with a goose. sô wart ûf der erde Then no one on earth nie keinen liuten baz." will ever have had it better." der abbet vienc der rede haz: The abbot became angry at these words. er hiez in swîgen. daz geschach. He bade him to be silent, and the monk was silent. dar nâch er aber schier sprach: But a second later he said: "gense daz ist ein wirtschaft, "Geese! That's a feast! ob aller wirtschaft ein überkraft The most almighty of feasts die in der werlt ieman gewan." that anyone in the world has ever enjoyed." der abt sprach zuo dem jungen man: The abbot said to the young man: "bruoder, tuot die rede hin. "Brother, be silent! wâ hin haben ir iuwern sin Where have you left your sense und iuwer witze getân? and your reason? nû mügt ir iuch doch wol verstân Now, you should know daz wir niht fleisches ezzen. that we don't eat meat. ich will mich des vermezzen I will demand ir müezt der rede buoz enpfân." that you do penance for your words." er hiez in balde dannan gân. Immediately after that, he ordered him to leave. des getorst der münich lâzen niht. The monk didn't dare to object, er sprach iedoch: "waz mir geschiht, but he spoke: "No matter what happens to me, guot weren gense, der sie mac han, geese would be good. For him who is able to have them, guot unde wolgetan." they are good and fine." hie mit wart er hin vertriben. At these words, he was thrown out. die andern alle dâ beliben The others all stayed there und schuofen um ir lîpnar. and busied themselves with their nourishment. dar nâch satzten si gar Afterwards they agreed on beide ir singen unde ir lesen, their chanting and readings wer des meister sölt wesen. and who should be responsible for them. dî daz allez wart gesat, When this was all agreed upon, der abt im gewinnen bat the abbot asked for aber disen jungen man. the young man to be brought to him. er fuort in von den liuten dan He took him away from the others an sîn heimlîch. to his room. er bat in flîziclîch He asked him fervently daz er im verjehe to tell him dâ von diu rede geschehe the reason why he said daz er der gense begert. that he desired geese. der münich in des gewert. The monk granted him that. dô er sô tiur wart gemant, When he was so strongly urged, dô verjach er im zehant he told him without hesitation reht der gense wârheit, the whole truth about geese als ich iu ê hân geseit, as I have told you before: wie er die gans hin under lie how he lay with the goose und sich die naht mit ir begie. and spent the night with her. dô daz der abbet bevant, When the abbot discovered this trûreclichen er sprach zehant: he replied right away with sadness: "leider mir, ir sît betrogen: "Alas, you have been betrayed. ich hân iu selbe verlogen. I myself have deceived you. crêde mich ez was ein wîp. Believe me, that was a woman. iuwer sinnelôser lîp Your ignorant body hât bî wîben gelegen. has lain with a woman. ich solt iuwer baz hân gepflegen, I should have taken better care of you, sô het ich reht getân." then I would have behaved dutifully." buoze hier er in empfân. He commanded him to do a penance. daz geschach nâch siner bet. The monk did as he was ordered, doch wen ich er im unreht tet: but I think he was treated unfairly. wan swaz er sünden dâ gewan, For, whatever sins he committed there, dâ was der apt schuldic an. the abbot was to blame for them. het er im die wârheit If he had told him the truth ungelogen und âne spot geseit, honestly and without lies, er het sich lîhte baz behuot. the monk would have guarded himself better. spot und lüge ist selten guot: Mockery and lying are seldom good; si sint sünde und ouch ân êre. they are sins and they are also without honour. waz sol ich dâ von sagen mêre What more shall I say about this denne ich hân alhie getân? than what I have already said? ez ist mîn geloube und hân den wân It is my belief and my assumption daz ze Swâben noch der münich sî that in Swabia there might still vil lîht zwên oder drî easily be two or three monks die diu wîp erkennent baz. who have a better understanding of women. gedienten die ir meister haz, If they annoy their superiors, die büezen ouch, daz ist mîn rât. they should also do penance. This is my advice. hie mit die rede ein ende hât. Here the story ends.  = transcription  = translation
