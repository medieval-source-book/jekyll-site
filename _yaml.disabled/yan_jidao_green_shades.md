  六麼令 To the tune “Six Beats” 綠陰春盡， Green shades of the trees mark the end of spring; 飛絮繞香閣。 catkins fly around the fragrant pavilion.Here the “fragrant pavilion” (香閣) refers to the residence of the speaker. 晚來翠眉宮樣， As night falls, I paint my eyebrows in the style that is popular within the palace, 巧把遠山學。 which delicately resembles the curve of the faraway mountains. 一寸狂心未說， The wilderness in my heart is not spoken, 已向橫波覺。 but the waves radiating from my eyes“Waves radiating from my eyes” (橫波) refers to the emotions of the woman expressed by her eyes. tell you the secret. 畫簾遮匝。 Painted curtains shield me, 新翻曲妙， and my newly-written song is marvelous. 暗許閒人帶偷掐。 I secretly allow the passers-by to overhear it, snatch it away and learn its rhythms. 前度書多隱語， In your last letter you used many cryptic words; 意淺愁難答。 although not hard to decipher, I worry that it’s hard for me to answer. 昨夜詩有回紋， Yesterday night your poem had palindromesThis means that the lyrics she sang would have read the same forwards as backwards.. 韻險還慵押。 The rhymes are precarious and tricky; I’m too lazy to follow. 都待笙歌散了， When the songs fade, 記取留時霎。 please remember the transience of your visit. 不消紅蠟。 No need to waste a red candleThis suggests that there is no need to carry a candle to light the way, because of the moonlight., 閒雲歸後， for as the idle clouds return, 月在庭花舊闌角。 moonlight shall light the old corner of the fences, just by the courtyard flowers.
