    常記溪亭日暮。 I often recall the sunset by Xiting Xiting is a famous natural spring in Jinan province, northern China.: 沉醉不知歸路。 I was drunk and didn't know the way back. 興盡晚回舟， I enjoyed myself entirely and, when it got late, started walking back to the boat. 誤入藕花深處。 I mistakenly walked deep into the lotuses.  爭渡。 Striving to get across, 爭渡。 striving to get across, 驚起一灘鷗鷺。 startling a bank of gulls and egrets into flight.
