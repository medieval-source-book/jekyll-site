    庭院深深深幾許， The courtyard is deep, how far does it extend? 雲窗霧閣常扃。 The windows and chambers, wrapped in mist, are always shut. 柳梢梅萼漸分明。 New willow shoots and plum blossoms grow. 春歸秣陵樹， Spring returns to the trees of Moling; 人客建康城。 I am a stranger in Jiankang CityBoth Moling and Jiankang are alternative names for the city of Nanjing, which is located in present-day Jiangsu Province, China.. 感月吟風多少事， Moved by the moon and chanting to the wind, how many things have happened! 如今老去無成。 Now I am old and have achieved nothing.  誰憐憔悴更凋零。 Who would pity thin and withered me? 試燈無意思， I have no interest in the lantern trialThe fifth day of the first month in the lunar calendar is the Lantern Festival, which is celebrated with grand lantern displays. These displays are practiced beforehand in “lantern trials.”, 踏雪沒心情。 I am not in the mood to walk through the snow.
