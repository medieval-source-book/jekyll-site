fulltext: "De sole et luna, dial. 1. Concerning the Sun and the Moon, the first dialogue \uFEFFSol est secundum philosophum oculus mundi, jocunditas dei, pulchritudo coeli, mensura temporum, virtus et origo omnium nascentium, dominus plantarum, doctor et perfector omnium stellarum. According to the philosopher, the Sun is the world’s eye, God’s delight, the beauty of the sky, the measure of time, the virtue and origin of all living beings, the lord of the plants, not to mention the teacher and perfecter of all stars. Luna vero, ut dicit Ambrosius in Exameron, est decor noctis, mater totius humoris et ministra, mensura temporum, dominatrix maris, immutatrix aëris et æmulatrix solis, et propter quod est æmulatrix solis, soli incepit detrahere et eum diffamare. The moon, however, as Ambrosius says in his Exameron, is the night’s finery, the mother and servant of all liquids, the measure of time, the queen of the sea, the transformer of the air, and the imitator of the Sun.  Sol autem hoc sentiens loquutus est lunæ dicens: quare mihi detrahis et blasphemas? The Sun, sensing this, spoke to the Moon, saying, “Why do you pull me down, and blaspheme me? Ego semper te illuminavi et præcessi, tu autem semper me odis et impugnas. I have always illuminated you, and gone ahead of you; yet now you hate me and attack me.” Cui luna: recede a me, quia te non diligo, cum propter tuum magnum splendorem ego nihil appretior in mundo; si non esses, seculo superlata essem ego. To whom the Moon answered, “Depart from me for I do not love you. After all, thanks to your great splendor, the world does not value me at all. If you did not exist, I would be extolled as the greatest being in the world.” Cui sol: ingrata sufficiat tibi magnificentia tua; si ego in die, tu vero in nocte perlustras. In turn, the Sun responded, “Thankless creature, let your magnificence satisfy you. Indeed, I shine in the day, but you shine at night. Obediamus ergo creatori nostro et noli superbire super me, sed me permitte lucere in die ac bona domini munire. Let us therefore obey our creator. Stop behaving arrogantly towards me, but allow me to shine during the day and guard over the good works of the Lord.” Luna vero magis animata recessit cum furore et stellas ad se clamavit aggregavitque magnum exercitum et cum sole prœliari cœit. At this, however, the Moon drew back, even more incensed with fury. She called the stars to herself, assembling a great army, and began to battle with the Sun. Sagittas enim mittebat adversus solem et cum jaculis percutere nitebatur. She sent arrows against the Sun and strove to pierce him with darts. Sol autem cum esset superius, descendit et lunam cum mucrone partitus est et stellas dejecit dicens: sie semper, cum eris rotunda, faciam tibi. Nevertheless, since the Sun inhabited a higher sphere, he simply descended and split the Moon with the point of his sword. Then, casting down the stars, he said, “Thus shall I always cleave you when you are full.” Hac enim de causa, ut fabulæ dicunt, luna nunquam rotunda permanet et stellæ casum habent. As the stories say, it is because of this that the Moon never stays full and the stars fall. Luna ergo coufusa in verecundia mansit dicens: turgidam melius partiri erat quam totam perire. The thwarted Moon wallowed in shame, saying: “It is better to be divided when overfull than to perish entirely.” Sic enim multi superbi et elati volunt sibi dominari nec superiorem vel similem cupiunt habere. In this way many of the proud and the powerful want to rule alone, and they desire to have neither superiors nor equals. Unde glosa: superbia est elatio incensa quæ inferioribus despiciens superioribus et paribus satagit dominari. Hence the following gloss: “Pride is incensed dignity which, despising inferiors, tries to rule over both superiors and equals. Nam velle quidem esse super omnes vituperabiliter malum est, sustinere alterum sibi similem gloriosum est, ut ait Chrysostomus. Indeed, to desire to outrank all others is horribly wicked, but it is glorious to hold another up as equal to oneself.” So says Chrysostomos. De talibus enim dicit poeta: tolluntur in altum ut lapsu graviori cadant. Concerning such matters, the poet says, “The exalted are raised up so that they can experience a more grievous fall. Et nota, quod, quanto est major assensus, tanto est major et periculosior casus. Moreover, it is known that the greater one’s popularity is, the more perilous his fall will be. Qui enim de plano et infimo loco cadit, cito resurgit, qui autem de alto, cito surgere nequit. For he who falls from a flat and low place rises again swiftly, but he who falls from a height cannot rise again swiftly.” Rami enim arboris, ut dicit Chrysostomus, qui staut in summitate, cito a magno vento franguntur, qui autem sunt ad radicem, conservantur. As Chrysostomus says, “The tree’s branches growing aloft are quickly broken by a great wind, but those at the root are saved.” Unde etiam ait Quintus Curtius, quendam dixisse Alexandro quod, licet arbor magna crescat in altum, tamen vento citius exstirpatur, et licet leo tam sit superbus, tarnen parvarum avium efficitur cibus. Quintus Curius also relates that someone once said to Alexander, “Although a great tree might grow into the heavens, it will nevertheless be uprooted quickly by wind. Similarly, although a lion might be so proud, he will eventually be made into the food of small birds.” Quidam philosopbus veniens ad sepulturam Alexandri ait: heri non sufficiebat isti totus mundus, hodie quinque sepultura pedum est contentus. When arriving at Alexander’s tomb, one philosopher said, “Yesterday the whole world was not enough for this man. Today, he is content with his five-foot grave.” \n"
