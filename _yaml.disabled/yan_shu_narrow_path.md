  踏莎行 To the tune “Treading on the Sedges" 小徑紅稀， On the narrow path, red flowers are few now, 芳郊綠徧。 While the fragrant countryside is green throughout. 高臺樹色陰陰見。 The color of the trees upon the high terrace appears dark and shady. 春風不解禁楊花， The spring breeze does not know to prevent the willow catkins 濛濛亂撲行人面。 from pelting the faces of passersby in a drizzle of fluff. 翠葉藏鶯， The verdant leaves hide the orioles; 珠簾隔燕。 The pearl curtain 爐香靜逐遊絲轉。 The incense burner quietly chases the winding smoke. 一場愁夢酒醒時，  After a sorrowful dream, as I sober up,  斜陽卻照深深院。 The slanting sun shines into the deep courtyard.
