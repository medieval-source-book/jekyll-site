  De Heinrico The Song of Heinrich Nunc almus assis filius thero euuigero thiernun Now help, kind son of the eternal Virgin, benignus fautor mihi, thaz ig iz cosan muozi my benevolent protector, so that I may tell de quodam duce, themo heron Heinriche, of a certain duke, of Lord Heinrich, qui cum dignitate thero Beiaro riche beuuarode. who governed the realm of Bavaria with honor. Intrans nempe nuntius, then keisar namoda her thus: Once there came a herald, who addressed the emperor thus: ›cur sedes‹ infit ›Otdo. ther unsar keisar guodo “Why are you, our good emperor Otto, still sitting?” he asked. hic adest Heinrich bringit her hera kuniglich. “Heinrich is here, he brings a kingly entourage dignum tibi fore thir seluemo ze sine.‹ that would be worthy of being your own.” Tunc surrexit Otdo, ther unsar keisar guodo, Then Otto stood up, our good emperor, perrexit illi obuiam inde uilo manig man. and went towards him [Heinrich] together with many men et excepit illum mid mihilon eron. And he greeted him [Heinrich] with great honor Primitus quoque dixit: ›uuillicumo Heinrich, First he said:  “Welcome, Heinrich, ambo uos equiuoci, bethiu goda endi mi: to both of you with the same name, from both God and me. nec non et socii, uuillicumo sid gi mi.‹ And to your companions, too: you are welcome here.”Literally: 'you are welcome to me'. Dato responso fane Heinriche so scono After the greeting was returned in kind by Heinrich, coniunxere manus. her leida ina in thaz godes hus: they took each other by the hand. He [Otto] lead him to the church: petierunt ambo thero godes genatheno. both sought the grace of God. Oramine facto intfieng ina auer Otdo, After the prayer Otto took him again [by the hand?] duxit in concilium mit michelon eron And lead him with great honor to the council et admisit illi so uuaz so her þar hafode, And granted him everything that he had at his disposal, preter quod regale, thes thir Heinrih ni gerade. except royal prerogative, which Heinrich never coveted. Tunc stetit al thiu sprakha sub firmo Heinriche: So thereafter all counseling was under Heinrich’s stewardship. quicquid Otdo fecit, al geried iz Heinrih: Whatever Otto did, Heinrich advised him so. quicquid ac omisit, ouch geried iz Heinrihc. And whatever Otto did not do, Heinrich advised him so, too. Hic non fuit ullus – thes hafon ig guoda fulleist There was nobody – this has been confirmed nobilibus ac liberis, thaz thid allaz uuar is – to me to be true by both noblemen and freemen – cui non fecisset Heinrich allero rehto gilich. to whom Heinrich would not have served complete justice.
