fulltext: "小院閒窗春色深。 Outside the window, the spring color deepens.\_ 重簾未卷影沈沈。 The layers of curtains have yet to be rolled up, casting heavy shadows. 倚樓無語理瑤琴。 Leaning against the building in silence, I played the beautiful zitherAlthough the literal meaning is \"beautiful zither\", \"瑶琴\" is also a specific term for a zither decorated with emeralds.. 遠岫出雲催薄暮， The distant mountains pierce through the clouds, brightening the night. 細風吹雨弄輕陰。 A gentle breeze blows through the rain, teasing the light clouds, turning the day cloudy. 梨花欲謝恐難禁。 I am afraid that it is hard to prevent the pear blossoms from withering. \n"
