  水龍吟 To the tune “Water Dragon Chant” 次韻章質夫楊花詞 Matching the Rhymes of Zhang Zhifu’s Song about Willow Catkins 似花還似非花 TheyRefers to the willow catkins. look like flowers but also do not look like them. 也無人惜從教墜 No one treasures them, letting them fall. 拋家傍路 They were tossed to the side of the road near home. 思量卻是 Yet, when you think about it, 無情有思 although they seem insentient, they do have thoughts. 縈損柔腸 They are the gentle heart, worn out by worries, 困酣嬌眼 drowsy charming eyes, 欲開還閉 closed again as they are just about to open. 夢隨風萬里 Their dreams ride with the wind for a thousand miles, 尋郎去處 searching for where their men have gone, 又還被鶯呼起 Yet, they are woken by the orioles. 不恨此花飛盡 I do not regret that these flowers have all flown away 恨西園 but regret that in the western garden, 落紅難綴  The fallen flowersThe literal translation of 落紅 is “fallen red”. When "red" is used as a noun, it often refers to flowers, so here the translator chooses to translate the phrase as “fallen flowers”. The flowers refer to the willow catkins. cannot be stitched back together. 曉來雨過 After the rain at dawn, 遺蹤何在 where are their traces now? 一池萍碎 There is a pool of shattered duckweedIt was believed that when catkins fell into water they became duckweed.. 春色三分  The spring charmRefers to the catkin. divides into three, 二分塵土 two become dust, 一分流水 one turns into flowing water. 細看來 Look at them carefully: 不是楊花 those are not willow catkins, 點點是離人淚     the little dots are the tears of leaving menThe “leaving men” here are not men willfully abandoning others, but those who are reluctant to depart..
