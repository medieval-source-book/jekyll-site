  臨江仙 To the tune “Immortal by the River” 夜歸臨皋 Returning at Night to LinggaoThe part of Huangzhou where the speaker was in exile. 夜飲東坡醒復醉， Drinking at night on the Eastern Slope "Eastern Slope" is not only the name of a hill, but also a pseudonym used by Su Shi. This line could also be rendered: "Drinking at night, Su Shi/Eastern Slope sobered up and got drunk again.", I sobered up and got drunk again. 歸來彷彿三更。  When I arrived back home, it was about midnightIn ancient China, the night time was divided into five periods (更). At the beginning of each period, drums were beaten by night watchmen. 三更 refers to the third period, roughly equivalent to midnight.. 家童鼻息已雷鳴。 The young servant was snoring like thunder, 敲門都不應， not responding, no matter how hard I knocked. 倚杖聽江聲。 Supported by a walking stick, I listened to the river. 長恨此身非我有， I have long regretted that this body does not belong to me. 何時忘卻營營。 When can I stop pursuing fame and money?“營營” literally means being busy without stopping, often with a negative connotation. It is also the onomatopoeia for the sound that flies make when flying around. It can also refer to the anxieties in one’s mind. An alternative interpretation could be “When can I forget these anxieties?” 夜闌風靜谷紋平。 The night comes to an end, the wind stops, and the waves in the ravine die down. 小舟從此逝， Let me drift away on a small boat from now on, 江海寄餘生。 And entrust the rest of my life to rivers and seas.
