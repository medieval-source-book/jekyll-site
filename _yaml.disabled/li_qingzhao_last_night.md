    昨夜雨疏風驟。 Last night, the rain was sparse and the wind was strong; 濃睡不消殘酒。 deep sleep did not absorb the remaining wine. 試問卷簾人， I asked the one who was rolling up the curtainThis refers to a female domestic servant.:  卻道海棠依舊。 she only said that the flowering crabapple was the same as before. 知否。 Don’t you know? 知否。 Don’t you know? 應是綠肥紅瘦。 The greens should be fat and the reds should be thinThe idea is that after the wash of rain and wind, the crabapple should be filled with green leaves and there should be fewer red flowers than before..
