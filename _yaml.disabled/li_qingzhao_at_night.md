fulltext: "夜來沉醉卸妝遲。 At night, I was drunk and did not take off my makeup. 梅萼插殘枝。 The plum blossom petals withered on the twig. 酒醒熏破春睡， As I sobered up, their smell broke the spring sleep; 夢斷不成歸。 the dream ended before I was able to reach home.\_ 人悄悄， There was no sound of people, 月依依。 The moon lingered on, 翠簾垂。 The emerald curtain rolled down. 更挼殘蕊， Again, I pinched the leftover petals, 更撚餘香， Again, I rubbed the remaining fragrance, 更得些時。 Again, I obtained some more time.\_ \n"
