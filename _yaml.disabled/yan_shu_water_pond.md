  木蘭花 To the tune “Magnolia Flower” 池塘水綠風微暖。 The water in the pond is green, and the wind is slightly warm. 記得玉真初見面。  I remember meeting Yuzhen 重頭歌韻響錚琮， The double-head song 入破舞腰紅亂旋。 As it began the coda 玉鉤闌下香階畔。 By the railings under the jade hooks 醉後不知斜日晚。 I was drunk, not knowing that the sun had slanted and the time was late. 當時共我賞花人， The men who appreciated the flowers with me at that time, 點檢如今無一半。 Now as I count them, are fewer than half.
