  浪淘沙 To the tune “Waves Scour the Sand” 把酒祝東風。 I hold up the wine and toast the eastern wind, 且共從容。  “Let us dally and not rush.” 垂楊紫陌洛城東。 Along the lilac-laden path with drooping willows in the east of Luoyang, 總是當時攜手處， Is where we used to walk hand in hand, 游遍芳叢。 Roaming among the thickets of fragrance.Fragrance refers to flowers 聚散苦匆匆。 Gathering together is always fleeting and separating is always bitter. 此恨無窮。 My regrets about this have no end. 今年花勝去年紅。 The flowers this year are redder than the last; 可惜明年花更好，  It is a pity that when next year's ones are even better, 知與誰同。 I do not know with whom I will look at them.
