  西江月 To the tune “The Moon Over the West River” 梅花 Plum Blossom 玉骨那愁瘴霧， Why would the jade bones (need to) worry about noxious airHuizhou, in China's far south, was considered uninhabitable due to its hot and humid weather. Northerners believed that its air contained harmful vapors.? 冰肌自有仙風。 The skin, translucent as iceImagery of ice and jade was used to convey the beauty of women’s bodies, clean like ice and smooth like jade. It comes from a philosophical work by Zhuangzi, in which he uses “skin of ice and bones of jade” to describe a deity living in the Gu Ye Mountain. The phrase suggests an otherworldly quality to Zhaoyun's beauty., was naturally endowed with a transcendent temperament.  海仙時遣探芳叢。 From time to time, the sea nymphsAccording to Chinese mythology, four dragon kings control the sea, but nymphs who live beneath the waves maintain its balance. This line implies that the plum blossom/Zhaoyun was so extraordinary that even the sea nymphs sought to learn about it/her. sent an envoy to explore this fragrant shrubRefers to the plum blossom.: 倒掛綠毛幺鳳。 a green-feathered bird like a phoenix, hanging upside downThis image of a remarkable bird as the envoy emphasises the specialness of the object of its research: the plum blossom/Zhaoyun. The phoenix has a special significance in Chinese mythology, and the color green is often associated with purity and luxury (and the jade already mentioned).. 素面常嫌粉涴， The natural face never liked being smudged by powder; 洗妝不褪唇紅。 after washing off its makeup, the rouge on its lips did not fade. 高情已逐曉雲空。 My lofty longings chased after the dawn cloudThe "dawn cloud" (曉雲, Xiao Yun) is a coded reference to Zhaoyun (朝雲): the only difference between the two Chinese words is the first character, yet these characters (曉 and 朝) are synonymous in Chinese, both meaning dawn, so the full expression means "dawn cloud" in both cases. Su Shi is using word play to hint that he’s writing about Zhaoyun. and vanished, 不與梨花同夢。 Sharing no dreams with the pear blossomsThis is a reference to a poem by a famous Tang Dynasty poet, Wang Changling 王昌龄. In the only surviving line of the poem, Wang Changling writes that after he saw plum blossoms, he dreamt of pear blossoms. By contrast, the final line here implies that Su Shi will not be dreaming of pear blossoms, i.e. he won't think of Zhaoyun (his plum blossom) and dream of another woman (a pear blossom), and will remain faithful to his memory of her..
