  水調歌頭 To the tune “Prelude to Water Melody” 丙辰中秋歡飲達旦 On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival in 1076 CE, 大醉作此篇兼懷子由 I drank in joy until dawn. Completely drunk, I wrote this piece to express my longing for ZiyouZiyou was the younger brother of the speaker.. 明月幾時有， How long will the full moon last? 把酒問青天。 I raise my wine cup and ask the azure sky. 不知天上宮闕， I wonder: in the palace up in the skyAccording to ancient Chinese folklore, there was a palace on the moon named Guanghan Palace 广寒宫, where a goddess resided by an osmanthus tree with her rabbit. “The palace up in the sky” refers to this palace., 今夕是何年。 Which year is it tonightIn Chinese mythology, a day in the human world is a year on the moon. By asking what year it is on the moon, the speaker is also asking what day it is in the human world.? 我欲乘風歸去， I want to ride the wind and returni.e. to the palace mentioned in the previous line., 又恐瓊樓玉宇，  yet I fear that in the jade and crystal mansion up there, 高處不勝寒。 so lofty and high, one cannot stand the cold. 起舞弄清影， I rise and dance with my own pure shadow; 何似在人間。 am I still in the world of men? 轉朱閣， The moon turns at the vermillion pavilion, 低綺戶， Hanging down at the carved window 照無眠。 and shining on sleepless me. 不應有恨， It cannot have pity on men, 何事長向別時圓。 yet why does it only become a full moon when people are apart? 人有悲歡離合， Men grieve, rejoice, separate, and reunite; 月有陰晴圓缺， The moon dims or brightens, waxes or wanes. 此事古難全。 Since antiquity, such things have never been perfect. 但願人長久， We can only hope that all our friends and families can live long lives, 千里共嬋娟。 Looking at the moon together, across a thousand miles.
