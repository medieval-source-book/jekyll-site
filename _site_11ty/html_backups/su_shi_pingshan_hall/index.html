Introduction and notes by Dante Zhu.</p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Introduction to the Text</h2><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ouyang Xiu, whose work is also included in this collection, was a highly respected and influential teacher of Su Shi. He built Pingshan Hall in 1048 CE. Before the composition of this song, Su Shi had passed by the hall twice due to transfers at work. The song marks the occasion of his third visit to Pingshan Hall, at which point Ouyang Xiu had long since passed away. The song serves to commemorate Su Shi’s teacher, as well as to reflect on the inconstancy of life; the latter effort is supported by Su Shi’s use of Buddhist imagery, such as “a flick of the finger” to express the rapid passing of time. The final lines, especially the sentiment that lived experience is a dream, refer to the philosophy of the <i>Diamond Sutra </i>(<span class="s2">金</span><span class="s4">刚经</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>ci </i>genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). <i>Ci </i>is usually translated into English as “song lyrics”. This is because <i>ci </i>were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of <i>ci </i>vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing <i>ci </i>would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertain- ment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying <i>ci </i>would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many <i>ci </i>poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of <i>ci</i>: <i>wǎnyuē </i>(<span class="s2">婉</span><span class="s4">约</span>, “graceful”) and <i>háofàng </i>(<span class="s2">豪放</span>, “bold”). The <i>wǎnyuē </i>subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the <i>háofàng </i>subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Su Shi <span class="s2">蘇軾 </span>is one of the most popular Chinese poets of all time, and certainly one of the best-known poets of the Song Dynasty. Among his many roles—principled politician, esteemed poet, celebrated calligrapher—he was also a major re- former of the <i>ci </i>genre. Before Su Shi, the primary form of <i>ci </i>was <i>wǎnyuē </i>(<span class="s2">婉</span><span class="s4">约</span>, “graceful”). This was considered to be an inferior form of literature due to its thematic focus on love and desire and its association with the courtesans who usually performed it. Su Shi wrote lyrics on a broad range of non-traditional topics, often closely related to his own life experience. His compositions dealt with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service. As a pioneer of the <i>háofàng </i>(<span class="s2">豪放</span>, “bold”) type of <i>ci</i>, he incorporated references to typically masculine pursuits, including frequent use of a hunting motif. He also frequently incorporated ideas from Buddhist philosophy and allusions to political events, which usually appeared only in more elevated forms of poetry.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although Su Shi was a highly-regarded poet during his lifetime, his political career was consistently unfortunate. In 1066, he was forced to leave the Court when he openly opposed the chancellor’s socio-economic reforms, known as the New Policies. Over the next thirteen years, he was frequently demoted, serving as prefect or sub-prefect in Hangzhou, Mizhou, Xuzhou and Huzhou. Many of his <i>ci </i>reference these postings and the exhaustion of constant travel. A report about the troubling economic conditions of local people written while he was prefect of Huzhou landed him in prison for three months. He was finally sent back to Hangzhou and given a job with no salary. Although living in poverty, he grew fond of Hangzhou and wrote many of his most famous <i>ci </i>there.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because of the occurrence of specific real names and locations in Su Shi’s lyrics, as well as the introductory notes he wrote to accompany many of them, his lyrics often invite a biographical reading. This differentiates him from other <i>ci </i>po- ets featured in this collection, whose writings did not usually reference their own lives in such a direct way. Yet although Su Shi’s lyrics evoke specific lived experiences, the enduring popularity of his poetry is due, in part, to the fact that diverse audiences can identify with the feelings he describes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">About this Edition</h2><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The original text of this <i>ci </i>is based on the edition by Tang Guizhang <span class="s2">唐圭璋</span>(<i>Quan Song Ci </i><span class="s2">全宋詞</span>, vol 1. Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1965). Punctuation follows the edition. Since <i>ci </i>poetry rarely includes personal pronouns, and gender-differentiated pronouns did not exist in Classical Chinese of this period, the gender of the speaker as well as their perspective (e.g. first-, second- or third-person) must often be deduced by the translator from context.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Further Reading</h2><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chang, Kang-i Sun. <i>The Evolution of Tz’u Poetry: from Late Tang to Northern Sung</i>.
