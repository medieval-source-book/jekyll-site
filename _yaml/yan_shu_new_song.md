  浣溪沙 To the tune “Sands of the Washing Stream” 一曲新詞酒一杯。 A single new song, a single cup of wine 去年天氣舊亭臺。 On the old terrace in last year’s weather. 夕陽西下幾時回。 The setting sun has gone west, when will it return? 無可奈何花落去。 There’s no help for it, the blossoms fall and disappear; 似曾相識燕歸來。 I seem to recognize them, the swallows come back again. 小園香徑獨徘徊。 On the fragrant path of the little garden, I linger alone.
