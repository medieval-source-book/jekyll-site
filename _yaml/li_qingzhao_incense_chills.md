  鳳凰臺上憶吹簫 To the Tune “On Top of the Phoenix Terrace, Recalling Flute Music” 香冷金猊 The incense chills in the golden lion; 被翻紅浪 the quilt stirs, a red wave. 起來慵自梳頭 I rise up, too listless to comb my hair. 任寶奩塵滿 I leave my jewel box covered with dust; 日上簾鉤 sunlight ascends the curtain hook. 生怕離懷別苦 I only fear the parting pains and farewell bitterness; 多少事 how much has happened? 欲說還休 I am about to say but refrain. 新來瘦 Recently, I have slimmed down. 非干病酒 It has nothing to do with drunken sickness, 不是悲秋 or autumn sorrow. 休休 Don’t, don’t; 這回去也 this time he will surely go. 千萬遍陽關 Even if I sing the “Yangguan” tune ten times, countless times, 也則難留 it is still hard to make him stay. 念武陵人遠 I will yearn for my loved one faraway. 煙鎖秦樓 Mists will lock up the Qin tower; 唯有樓前流水 only the running water in front of the tower 應念我 will remember me 終日凝眸 staring at it all day. 凝眸處 At the spot where I stare, 從今又添 from now on, there will be 一段新愁 another layer of new sorrow.
