     Omnipotens sempiterne Deus qui es sine fine et principio, qui creasti omnia ex nichilo. All Powerful, Eternal God, without end or beginning, who created everything out of nothing; Ad cuius imperium mare constituitur dum ultimos terminos numquam progreditur. by whose power the sea was created, which never extends to the furthest reaches; Qui fecisti terram et flumina ventorum in cavernis eius concludis. who made the earth and contained the flow of winds in the caves, Qui etiam inestimabili potentia ex durissimo ligno mollia deducis semina. and who even now brings forth soft seeds out of the hardest wood with unimaginable power; Qui formasti Adam de limo terre mulieremque de latere eius formans ei inconiugium sociasti, who formed Adam from the dust of the earth, and forming woman from his side, joined her and him in matrimony, et ad propagandam posterorum sobolem perpetuam dedisti eis benedictionem dicens and for the sake of growing future generations, gave them perpetual progeny and a blessing, saying: crescite et multiplicamini et replete terram et dominamini volatilibus caeli, et piscibus maris nec non bestiis totius diversitatis. "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and have dominion over the birds of the air and the fish of the sea and beasts, too, of all kinds";  Qui Abraham patriarcham et coniugem eius Saram licet maturiori aetate prouectos insperate proles noue fecundasti. who extraordinarily made Abraham the Patriarch and his wife Sarah fertile, granting the elderly pair offspring unexpectedly despite their advanced age; Qui etiam cooperante Spiritu Sancto de sinu tuo misisti filium tuum Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum ad intemerate Virginis uterum, ut uma humana lege inpregnantem lateret domo. who also, with the Holy Spirit, sent your son, our Lord Jesus Christ, from your bosom to the womb of the immaculate Virgin, so that he might lie hidden in the pregnant woman as in a house in accordance with the human law,  et post legitimum nouem mencium munerum velut e thalamo suo procedens nascendo virginis relinqueret uterum.  and after the proper nine months of service, as if leaving his bedroom, with his birth he leaves the Virginâ€™s womb. Qui etiam pereundem filium cum duodecim apostolis ceterisque fidelibus Christianis inquiens promisisti: who furthermore, through that son, and with twelve Apostles and other faithful Christians, made a promise, saying: quodcumque pecielitis patrem in nomine meo dabit vobis. "Whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you"; per illum filium similiter cum Spiritu Sancto te Deum patrem deprecor through that son, just as through the Holy Spirit, I pray to you, God, the Father, ut huic famule tuae gravide pregnanti interueniat pietatis tuae auxilium that the aid of your pity might extend to your pregnant servant, heavy with child,  ut prolem tibi gratam sine mortis periculo valeat producere et tuo cultui dignam ac deuotam enutrire so that she may prevail in producing a child pleasing to you, without danger of death, and in nourishing a child worthy of serving you and devoted to worshipping you. per eundem Dominum nostrum et cetera. By our same Lord, etc.
