  西江月 To the tune "The Moon Over the West River" 春夜行蘄水中過酒家飲。 Riding along the Qi River on a spring night, I stopped by an inn, where I had a few cupsRefers to cups of alcohol, but the type of alcohol is unspecified.. 酒醉， I got drunk, 乘月至 一溪橋上， and in the moonlight I stopped on a bridge over a creek; 解鞍曲肱少休。 taking down the saddle, I bent my arm and rested for a while. 及覺， When I woke up, 已曉。 it was already dawn. 亂山葱蘢， The disarray of mountains were green and lush; 不謂塵世也。 I thought that I was no longer in the dusty worldThe dust (塵) here means the dust scattered on the road when the carriages and horses pass through.  塵世 ("dusty world") was originally used to describe the noisy and bustling city, but became a metaphor for a society filled with distractions and false appearances. It often implies a sentiment of rejecting or being bored by this kind of lifestyle, and wanting to have something truthful (love, tranquility, or religious belief) which will transcend the pursuit of money or fame. It may also bear a spiritual meaning, in which the "dusty world" signifies the mortal world.. 書此語橋柱 Thus I wroteWith a writing brush specifically for calligraphy. this on one of the pillars of the bridge. 照野瀰瀰淺浪， The moon shines on the wild fields; low waves surge on the vast water. 橫空隱隱層霄。 Across the sky are dim layers of clouds. 障泥未解玉驄驕。 The saddle is still tied to my fine, strong steed. 我欲醉眠芳草。 Yet I want to lie in drunkenness among the grass and flowers. 可惜一溪風月， How lovely, the beautiful moonlit view and the refreshing breeze on the creek. 莫教踏碎瓊瑤。 Do not let it trample the jade-like reflection of the creek into pieces“It” refers to the horse.! 解鞍欹枕綠楊橋。 I untie the saddle, lean on it as a pillow, and lie on the Lü Yang bridge. 杜宇一聲春曉。 The cuckoo utters one cry and it is already dawn of a spring day.
