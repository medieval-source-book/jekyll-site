  江城子 To the tune “River Town” 密州出獵 Hunting in Mizhou 老夫聊發少年狂。 I take on a young man’s arrogance for a moment,  左牽黃。 Pulling a yellow dog with my left hand, 右擎蒼。 And holding a goshawk with my right. 錦帽貂裘, I am capped in brocades and clothed in a mink fur coatRefers to the typical hunting attire of a prefect at that time., 千騎卷平岡。 And thousands of cavalrymen are sweeping the smooth hillside.The speaker uses “thousands of” as an exaggeration to emphasize the size of his retinue and the grandeur of the occasion. 爲報傾城隨太守。 To show gratitude to the entire town for following me hunting, 親射虎, I will shoot the tiger myself, 看孫郎。 like Sun Quan.Sun Quan (182-252 CE) was the ruler of the State of Wu during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 CE). He once pursued a tiger on horseback, managing to kill it even though it had bitten his horse. Here the speaker compares himself to Sun Quan. 酒酣胸膽尚開張。 As I drink to satisfaction, my chest opens and my courage is strengthened. 鬢微霜。 My temples are touched by frost This implies that the poet is already old and has white hair at his temples.,  又何妨。 But why bother with that? 持節雲中。 Feng Tang, who went to YunzhongYunzhong was the name of a place in present-day Inner Mongolia. with a Fu JieDuring the Song Dynasty, a “Fu Jie” was a staff that symbolized the court’s pardon of an official.: 何日遣馮唐。 when will the court dispatch himThe implication here is “When will the court dispatch Feng Tang to pardon Wei Shang?”, with the poet using Wei Shang to represent himself. The Prefect of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, successfully defeated the invading Xiongnu troops but was deprived of his official title because his battle report stated a number of enemies killed that was six fewer than the actual number. Feng Tang, a court official, defended the prefect and convinced Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180-157 BCE) that his sentence was too severe. The emperor thus sent Feng Tang to pardon the prefect and restore the latter’s title. Here the speaker refers to himself as the prefect and hopes to retrieve the court’s trust and favor. The order of the words in the original has been modified in the translation to make the sentence easier to understand. The literal translation of this line and the preceding line is: “Going into Yunzhong with a Fu Jie; / When will the court dispatch Feng Tang?”? 會挽雕弓如滿月, By that time I will pull my carved bow into the shape of a full moon, 西北望, aim to the northwest, 射天狼。 and shoot down SiriusIn ancient China, “Sirius” was the name given to a star that was commonly believed to control warfare. “Shoot down Sirius” indicates the speaker’s wish to defeat major rivaling states, very likely the Western Xia in the northwest, which was a great threat to the Northern Song court..
