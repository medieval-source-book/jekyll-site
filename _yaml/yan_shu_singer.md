  贈歌者 To a singer 家住西秦。 My family lived in the west of Qin, 賭博藝隨身。 I lived by my skills and talent in dancing and song; 花柳上、鬥尖新。 among all the blossoms and willows, 偶學念奴聲調， Occasionally I imitated the tunes of Niannu, 有時高遏行雲。 my voice could halt floating clouds in their path. 蜀錦纏頭無數， I have countless Shu brocades and silks, 不負辛勤。 my efforts were well-rewarded. 數年來往咸京道， For years now I have traveled between Xianyang and the capital. 殘杯冷炙謾消魂。 Leftover wine and cold food consume my spirit. 衷腸事、託何人。 To whom can I confide the things deep in my heart? 若有知音見採， If a patron who appreciated me would choose me, 不辭遍唱陽春。 I would willingly sing every one of the finest songs. 一曲當筵落淚， Now, a single song at the banquet and my tears start to fall. 重掩羅巾。 Once again, I hide my face with the silk kerchief.
