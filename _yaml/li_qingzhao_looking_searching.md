  聲聲慢 To the tune “Note after Note, Long Song” 尋尋覓覓， Looking and searching, looking and searching, 冷冷清清， cold and quiet, cold and quiet, 淒淒慘慘戚戚。 lonesome, dismayed, and desolate; lonesome, dismayed, and desolate. 乍暖還寒時候， At the time when it has just turned warm yet is still quite cold, 最難將息。 it is the hardest for one to rest. 三杯兩盞淡酒， How can two or three cups of weak wine 怎敵他、 shield one from 晚來風急。 the harsh wind in the evening? 雁過也， The wild geese have flown past; 正傷心， what truly pains the heart, 卻是舊時相識。 is that I knew them from the past. 滿地黃花堆積。 Yellow flowers pile all over the ground, 憔悴損， withered and wilted. 如今有誰堪摘。 Now who would pluck them? 守著窗兒， I guard the window; 獨自怎生得黑。 how do I endure this darkness by myself? 梧桐更兼細雨， The parasol tree in the slight rain 到黃昏、 at dusk, 點點滴滴。 dripping and drizzling, dripping and drizzling. 這次第， In such circumstances, 怎一個愁字了得。 how could the single word “sorrow” suffice?
