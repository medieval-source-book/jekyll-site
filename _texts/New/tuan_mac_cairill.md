## Introduction to the Source 
<p>This song has been transcribed from the Chansonnier Nivelle de la Chausée (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Département de Musique, Res. Vmc MS 57), ff.25v-26r. The manuscript can be viewed <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55007270r/f50.item">here</a>. Another version with minor variants and a different final line is contained in London British Library Lansdowne 380.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>This anonymous love song comes from a fifteenth-century chansonnier of polyphonic music (music where several voices sing different musical lines at the same time). It is somewhat unusual in that it is written from the perspective of a woman reflecting on the bond she shares with her distant lover.</p>
